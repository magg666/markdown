I am happy to learn coding. It is new for me and I find it interesting and exciting.

But I was also educator, social worker, treasurer, coordinator of EU projects, owner of my own company and ~~therapist~~.

\*This is my first python function \*:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello World!")
```

## The beings I live with

| Being                | Genre |                  Name |
| -------------------- | ----: | --------------------: |
| Husband              | Human | The Greatest Man [^1] |
| Favorite animal      |   Dog |                 Dyzio |
| Also favorite animal |   Cat |                  Ruda |

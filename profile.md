I am happy to learn coding. It is new for me and I find it interesting and exciting.

But I was also educator, social worker, treasurer, coordinator of EU projects, owner of my own company and ~~therapist~~.

\*This is my first python function \*:

``` python
def hello():
    print("Hello World!")
```
